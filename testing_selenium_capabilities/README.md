# Testing Selenium Capabilities

In order to master Selenium + Python3 I decided to go over on "Selenium with Python" documentation and test all basic capabilities with various browsers.

### Topics covered:

1. Simple Usage: ```assert, driver.title, send_keys, find_element_by_name, clear```
2. Using Selenium to write tests: ```setUpClass, setUp, tearDown, tearDownClass, self.assertIn, self.assertFalse, driver.maximize_window```

### Note: 
In order to instantiate webdriver I use Driver class of my own. For more info please look here: https://github.com/ikostan/SELENIUM_WEBDRIVER_WORKING_WITH_ELEMENTS/tree/master/driver

### Supported browsers:
- Chrome
- IE
- Firefox
